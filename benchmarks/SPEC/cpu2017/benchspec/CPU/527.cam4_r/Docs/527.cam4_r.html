   <h1>527.cam4_r<br />SPEC CPU&reg;2017 Benchmark Description</h1>
</center>
<h3>Benchmark Name</h3>
<p>527.cam4_r</p>
<h3>Benchmark Author</h3>
<p>National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</p>
<h3>Benchmark Program General Category</h3>
<p>Atmosphere General Circulation Model (AGCM)</p>
<h3>Benchmark Description</h3>
<p>The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) is the atmosphere component used by
the Community Earth System Model (CESM).  </p>
<p>This benchmark is running
   code which is part of the publicly released CESM-1.0.2.  The version of
   CAM in that release is CAM-5.0.  In order to obtain as robust a
   validation procedure as possible, the benchmark runs use a special
   configuration which employs a prescribed ocean only lower boundary
   condition.  This is the configuration used by the Aqua-Planet
   Experiment Project.  </p>
   <p>The model is run in a backwards
   compatibility mode to use the "cam4" physics package that was originally
   released in CAM-4.0, and which has been used in the majority of the CESM
   simulations done for CMIP5, as analyzed for the IPCC Fifth
   Assessment Report (AR5).  </p>
   <p>The validation procedure uses a perturbation
   growth test described <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/cam/docs/port/">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Input Description</h3>

<p>The files atm_in and drv_in contain the Namelist groups read by CAM and
   are documented <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/cam/docs/ug5_0/ug.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>The data sets are identical for all four of the SPEC&reg;-provided workloads (test, train, refrate, refspeed), with some
differences in how they are processed:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Test and train do a smaller number of steps than the reference workloads.</li>
   <li>At compile time, the speed version (627.cam4_s) includes the flag -DUSE_COSP.  Therefore, the speed version processes
   each of the workloads using the COSP simulator.  The rate version (527.cam4_r) does not use COSP.</li>
   <li>The namelist variable <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/eaton/namelist/nldef2html-pub">nhtfrq</a> controls the
   write frequency for the history file.  For test and train, the frequency is every timestep (1).  For the reference
   workloads, the frequency is 30 timesteps.</li>
</ul>  

<h3>Output Description</h3>

<p>The log file, written to standard out, contains a summary of how the
   model has been configured.  Some global statistics of the atmospheric
   state are printed for each model time step.</p>

   <p>The netCDF output file, <samp>h0.nc</samp>, contains global temperature fields for the written timesteps.</p>

   <h3>Validation</h3>

   <p>The program <samp>cam4_validate</samp> (which is built at the same time as the benchmark binary) compares
   <samp>h0.nc</samp>
   vs. SPEC's expected outputs using a root mean square differences.  The validation program accepts 4 parameters:</p>
<pre>
  maxf:   Maxium of failures to print
  reltol: Allowable Relative tolerance 
  ctrl:   Expected results (provided by SPEC)
  bench:  Results from a benchmark run
</pre>
<p>The tolerance mentioned just above is set by routine <samp>compare_commands</samp> within
<samp>527.cam4_r/Spec/object.pm</samp>.</p>
<p>Lastly, <samp>specdiff</samp> checks the output of cam4_validate</p>

<p><b>What this means when deciphering log files:</b> If your run fails, you may see something like the following in the
<samp>$SPEC/result</samp> log file:</p>
<pre>
*** Miscompare of cam4_validate.txt; for details see
    /path/527.cam4_r/run/run_mumble.0000/cam4_validate.txt.mis
0001:   PASS:  4  points.
        Failure at Step:  2 1 1 1
        ^
</pre>
<p>The above message means that <samp>specdiff</samp> expected to find that <samp>cam4_validate</samp> had written
<samp>PASS</samp> but
instead <samp>cam4_validate</samp> has written other stuff.  To find the details, you should <samp>cd</samp> to the run directory
that was referenced in the log file, and examine <samp>cam4_validate.txt</samp>.</p>

<pre>
$ head -4 cam4_validate.txt
 Failure at Step:  2 1 1 1
          Actual:  218.14015096246447
        Expected:  217.62126113318524
          Reltol:  2.384371024123735E-3
$ 
</pre>

<p>In the above example, the validation utility has printed the actual and expected values, and has indicated the
validation tolerance that would be needed if this difference were acceptable.</p>

   <h3>Programming Language</h3>

<p>Fortran90 and C</p>
<h3>Version and Licensing</h3>
<p>The CAM-5.0 code has been extracted from CESM-1.0.2 and is public domain
   software.</p>

<h3 id="portability">Known portability issues</h3>
<ol>
   <li><p><b>Data format:</b> Depends on NETCDF as packaged with the benchmark.  By default, the workload will be formatted to
      use big endian.  To use little endian formatting, set the appropriate compiler option to byte-swap the input I/O or set
      the define flag <samp>SPEC_WORDS_LITTLEENDIAN</samp>.</p></li>

   <li><p><b>Stack:</b> The OpenMP version of CAM4 uses a large amount of stack space.  The exact amount will vary by system,
      compiler, and number of threads.  You will most likely need to set both the process stack and the OpenMP environment
      variable <samp>OMP_STACKSIZE</samp> to a large value, such as 128M or greater.  See the examples at 
      <a class="external" href="https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/config.html#preenv">config.html#preenv</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p><b>spec_qsort and ANSI aliasing:</b> The <samp>spec_qsort.c</samp> routine does not strictly obey the ANSI aliasing
      rules.  See the detailed discussion in the documentation for 
      <a class="external" href="https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/benchmarks/505.mcf_r.html#Portability">505.mcf_r</a>, which 
      is where the problem was reported.</p>

      <p>If you are compiling with the GCC compiler, it is theoretically possible that you might need to add 
      <samp style="white-space:nowrap;">-fno-strict-aliasing</samp> to 527.cam4_r as well.   The Example GCC config 
      files as updated for SPEC CPU 2017 v1.1.5 demonstrate how to do so.</p> </li>
   

   <li><p class="snugbot"><b>GCC 10 argument mismatch</b>:   If you compile using GCC 10 (and presumably later) compilers,
      you must use <kbd class="nbsnugr">-fallow-argument-mismatch</kbd>.  If you do not include this flag, compiles
      will fail with message: </p>
      <pre class="snugish">Error: Type mismatch between actual argument at (1) and actual argument at (2)</pre>  
      <p class="snugish">For more information, see   
      <a class="external" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html">https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html</a>.
      </p>

      <p><span class="alarm">Note</span> that in accordance with the same-for-all rule 
       <a class="external" href="https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#BaseFlags">
          www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#BaseFlags</a> it is not allowed to set 
       <kbd class="nb">-fallow-argument-mismatch</kbd> as a PORTABILITY option.  Instead, it must be applied to all of 
       Base.  The Example GCC config files as updated for SPEC CPU 2017 v1.1.4 obey this rule.</p> </li>
