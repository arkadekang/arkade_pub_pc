                     SPEC CPU(R)2017 Benchmark Description

  Benchmark Name

   628.pop2_s

  Benchmark Author

   Ocean Model Working Group and Los Alamos National Laboratory.
   CESM is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S.
   Department of Energy (DOE). Administration of the CESM is maintained by
   the Climate and Global Dynamics Division (CGD) at the National Center for
   Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

  Benchmark Program General Category

   Climate modeling

  Benchmark Description

   The Parallel Ocean Program (POP) was developed at LANL under the
   sponsorship of the Department of Energy's CHAMMP program, which brought
   massively parallel computers to the realm of climate modeling. POP is a
   descendent of the Bryan-Cox-Semtner class of ocean models first developed
   by Kirk Bryan and Michael Cox [4] at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
   Laboratory in Princeton, NJ in the late 1960s. POP had its origins in a
   version of the model developed by Semtner and Chervin [18] [5].

   628.pop2_s is a port to SPEC based on the CESM1.0 (Community Earth System
   Model) coupled climate model for simulating the earth's climate system.
   Composed of four separate models simultaneously simulating the earth's
   atmosphere, ocean, land surface and sea-ice, and one central coupler
   component, the CESM allows researchers to conduct fundamental research
   into the earth's past, present and future climate states.

   The ocean component of the CESM1.0 is the Parallel Ocean Program version 2
   (POP2). This model is based on the POP version 2.1 of the Los Alamos
   National Laboratory; however, it includes many physical and software
   developments incorporated by the members of the Ocean Model Working Group

   MPI Stubs This version of POP does not use MPI. A set of 'mpi_serial' of
   routines were used to avoid removing the MPI calls all over the place

  Input Description

   As 628.pop2_s contains the coupled system (CESM) there are a lot of input
   files, notably:
   drv_in.in, pop2_in, dlnd_in, dice_in and datm_in
   plus a lot of other text, binary and netcdf files.

   The datasets are based on CESM data for COMPSET=C RES=4x5_gx3v7, but to
   reduce the size of 628.pop2_s datasets the files are truncated using
   ncdump/ncgen NETCDF utilities to represent 62 days of simulation.

   The test, train and ref datasets are identical except for number of days
   to simulate: 1, 5 and 50.

   The workload can be adjusted by changing number of days simulation in
   drv_in.in. In addition, a second parameter in pop2_in: steps_per_day can
   be adjusted (for example, 12 vs 24 takes approximately twice as long).

   Much more information about the inputs may be found in the [1]Parallel
   Ocean Program (POP) User Guide

  Output Description

   Similarly to the input files, as 628.pop2_s is part of a coupled system
   (CESM) there are a lot of text and binary output files. The most important
   one is
   ocn.log which also is the file used in verification/validation of the run.

  Programming Language

   Fortran90 and C (for the NETCDF library which is an integral part of the
   ported code

  Known portability issues

    1. GCC 10 argument mismatch: If you compile using GCC 10 (and presumably
       later) compilers, you must use -fallow-argument-mismatch. If you do
       not include this flag, compiles will fail with message:

 Error: Type mismatch between actual argument at (1) and actual argument at (2)

       For more information, see
       [3]https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html.

       Note that in accordance with the same-for-all rule
       [4]www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#BaseFlags it is not allowed
       to set -fallow-argument-mismatch as a PORTABILITY option. Instead, it
       must be applied to all of Base. The Example GCC config files as
       updated for SPEC CPU 2017 v1.1.5 obey this rule.

    2. floating-point exceptions with GCC: Users of GCC may encounter errors
       similar to these:

     *** Miscompare of ocn.log
        1513:    Chlorophyll transmission table computed
                 Could not find range for chlamnt =  1.0000E-03

       Note: The following floating-point exceptions are signalling: IEEE_UNDERFLOW_FLAG
       POP aborting...
         set_chl_trans range error for chlamnt

       The problem appears to be a comparison to an exact value which is no
       longer exact in the presence of certain optimizations, as discussed at
       [5]https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=82004

       Suggested workaround: use [6]basepeak for 628.pop2_s. The GCC Example
       config files supplied with CPU 2017 v1.1.5 demonstrate how to do this.

    Data Formats and Endian Issues

   Some input files are not read by NetCDF; instead, they are read as
   unformatted data from big-endian format files. If you are using a
   little-endian platform, you will probably need to provide a compiler flag
   so that those files can be read properly. For example:

     * GCC on little-endian systems -fconvert=big-endian.
     * Oracle Solaris Studio on a little-endian platform:
       -xfilebyteorder=big8
     * Intel Fortan: -convert big_endian

    NAMELIST Input Processing

   When reading NAMELIST input, your compiler needs to respect punctuation
   marks required by the Fortran 2003 standard (section 10.10.1.2 and note
   10.35). For example, consider the data file below.

 $ cat -n datm_atm_in
    1     &shr_strdata_nml
    2       dataMode       = 'CORE2'
    3       domainFile     = './domain.lnd.fv4x5_gx3v7.091218.nc'
    4       streams        = 'nyf.giss.T62.stream.txt 1 1 1 ' ,
    5                        'nyf.gxgxs.T62.stream.txt 1 1 1 ' ,
    6                        'nyf.ncep.T62.stream.txt 1 1 1 '
    7       vectors        = 'u:v'
    8       mapmask        = 'nomask',
    9                        'nomask',
   10                        'nomask'
   11       tintalgo       = 'linear',
   12                        'linear',
   13                        'linear'
   14      /
 $

   Your compiler must recognize that 3 elements are assigned for streams, 3
   elements for mapmask, and so forth.
